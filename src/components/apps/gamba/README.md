# Gamba Protocol Integration

## Overview
The Gamba Protocol serves as a key revenue stream for the $AIS project through a strategic partnership with Solana's premier decentralized casino platform. This integration allows us to tap into the growing blockchain gambling market while providing value to both $AIS holders and casino participants.

## Revenue Generation Model

### Distribution Structure
- **Total Revenue Share**: 10% of all gambling profits using SmithOS referral code
  - 5% → $AIS Treasury
  - 2% → Token Holders (via buybacks/burns)
  - 3% → Development & Marketing

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Referral System**
   - Unique referral code: `SMITHOS`
   - Automatic tracking of all plays
   - Real-time revenue distribution

2. **Smart Contract Integration**

   - Instant token buybacks
   - Programmatic burns
   - Audited by Halborn Security
